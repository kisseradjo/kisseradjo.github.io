      <p>I am excited to welcome you into a tini-tiny bit of my awesome world. Buckle up! Jojo Brandon Smyth is my name and I live and breath art! I am an artist who has been practising since 2014. My work as an artist has been one of the most exciting and
        fulfilling yet frustrating and unpredictable journeys. And I try to juggle being a student with my practice as an artist.</p>

        <h2>I love to;</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Travel ...Roadtrips are awesome</li>
          <li> And now, code.</li>

      <p>I try to love dogs. I pretend to love jazz and classical music simply because most people think it is cool. I fight shotokhan karate but I certainly shouldn't be an example for your kids. It is quite tough so I am very lazy about it.</p>

      <p>Learning to code and program is considered a cool thing now but my reason for learning it has nothing to do with that. In fact, I suspect I might have a very unstable relationship with it. However, I think I love it and that's a good thing. It is
        beautiful how a lot can be birthed through text and a lot of 'geeky' writing. And that's amazing! Learning to code was important for me because I am an artist who believes in the potential that technology has to transform.</p>
